Built on the design principles developed by [Ant Design](http://ant.design/), this project introduces higher level components; we have developed templates, components, and a corresponding design kit to improve the user and development experience for admin interfaces.\n\n\nYour help is welcomed and much appreciated. With your feedback we can make incremental progress towards elegant and well designed components. Please open a issue or submit a pull request!\n\nWith those objectives in mind, we have built the following templates and a scaffold based on React.js, which should help you prototyping production-ready admin interfaces.\n\n```\n- Dashboard\n  - Analytic\n  - Monitor\n  - Workspace\n- Form\n  - Basic Form\n  - Step Form\n  - Advanced Form\n- List\n  - Standard Table\n  - Standard List\n  - Card List\n  - Search List (Project/Applications/Article)\n- Profile\n  - Simple Profile\n  - Advanced Profile\n- Result\n  - Success\n  - Failed\n- Exception\n  - 403\n  - 404\n  - 500\n- Account\n  - Account Center\n  - Account Settings\n- User\n  - Login\n  - Register\n  - Register Result\n```\n\n## Preparation\n\nYou will need [node](http://nodejs.org/), [git](https://git-scm.com/). The project is based on  [ES2015+](http://es6.ruanyifeng.com/)、[Vue.Js](https://vuejs.org/)、[Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/)、[Vue-Router](https://router.vuejs.org/)、[g2](https://antv.alipay.com/zh-cn/g2/3.x/index.html) and [antd-vue](https://vue.ant.design/docs/vue/introduce-cn/). It would be helpful if you have pre-existing knowledge on those.\n\n## Installation\n\nClone the project from Github.\n\n```bash\n$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/vueComponent/ant-design-vue-pro.git my-project\n$ cd my-project\n```\n\n## Scaffolding\n\nWe have provided a scaffold which includes common routes for admins and demonstrates our component library. The project layout is as follows:\n\n```bash\n├── public\n│   └── logo.png             # LOGO\n|   └── index.html           # Vue entrance template\n├── src\n│   ├── api                  # Api, ajax, etc.\n│   ├── assets               # Local static files\n│   ├── config               # Basic config, include routes and global configuration\n│   ├── components           # Components\n│   ├── core                 # Starter, project configuration, library\n│   ├── router               # Vue-Router\n│   ├── store                # Vuex\n│   ├── utils                # Utilities\n│   ├── locales              # I18n resouces\n│   ├── views                # Sub-pages and templates\n│   ├── App.vue              # Vue template entrance\n│   └── main.js              # Vue javascript entrance\n│   └── permission.js        # Router permission control\n│   └── global.less          # Global CSS\n├── tests                    # Tests Configuration\n├── README.md\n└── package.json\n```\n\n1. **Tip:  Use this project, please carefully check which dependencies are introduced in src/main.js**\n2. **Tip:  This project uses on-demand loading. Some components are not used and have not been dated to the project. When you encounter a prompt that there is no registered component, you can make an appointment by yourself! !**\n\n\n\n## Development\n\nInstall Dependencies:\n\n```bash\n$ yarn install\n```\nRun server:\n```bash\n$ yarn run serve\n```\n\nThis will automatically open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8080), If you see the following page then you have succeeded.\n![](/assets/user_layout.jpg)\n\nYou're all set!\n\nWe have built-in mock data, hot module reloading, state management,i18n, global router, etc. You can continue exploring other documents for more details on those topics.\n"}}]);
